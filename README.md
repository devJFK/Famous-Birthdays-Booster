## Information
This tool was strictly developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to abuse a service like [Famous Birthdays](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/). This bot is using proxies to prevent rate limits along with identity leaks. Please refrain from using this **Famous Birthdays Booster** as it is spamming their API. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

Keep in mind that it takes a while for the rank to be updated — confirm by boosting manually.

## Usage
- Python 3.8 or above is required.
- I develop for Windows machines only and do not intentionally support other operating systems.
- If you do not already have the **Requests** library installed, run setup.py — make sure PIP is added to PATH.
1. Paste HTTP proxies in .\Proxies.txt.
2. Run main.py.

## Legal Notice
This is illegal if you use it without the consent of the creators — in this case, the **Famous Birthdays** team. I am not accountable for any of your actions; this was merely a speedrun to demonstrate how "boosters" work. Please do not misuse this tool.
